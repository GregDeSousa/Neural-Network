# Neural Network Visualizer

This repository contains a neural network implementation and a visualizer for the network using Tkinter. The neural network is trained using backpropagation on a dataset read from a CSV file. The visualizer helps to display the network's structure, activations, and weights.

## Description

The project includes:
- A neural network implementation with forward propagation and backpropagation.
- A visualizer to display the network's structure, activations, and weights using Tkinter.

## Files

- `neural_network.py`: Main code for the neural network and visualizer.

## Usage

To use the neural network and visualizer, run the `neural_network.py` script. The script includes test inputs and will display the network's structure, activations, and weights.

## Installation

To run the code, you need to have Python and Tkinter installed. You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
